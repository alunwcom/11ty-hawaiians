During the last couple of months of Covid-19 lockdown Guy Smith, aka Smiffy, has collaborated with local musicians to create a new version of ‘We Stand Together’.

The track, originally written and recorded by the Normil Hawaiians in 2017, is planned for release with other new Hawaiians material in the future – though no date has yet been set.
