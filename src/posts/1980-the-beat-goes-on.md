1. VENTILATION (Smith,J Armstrong)

Guy and Jim – vocals and guitar, Janet – vocal, Nick Rose – bass, Chris – drums, Sue Leeves and Sarah Harley – backing vocals, The Famous Delfonso – sax, Roger Smith – violin.

Ex-Clash roadie and nice man Nick Rose joins on bass, The Heartbeats Chris ‘wacker’ Westerman continues to stand in on drums. An accapella version of ‘Heaven’ from the film ‘Eraserhead’ is uncredited at the end of ventilation on side 2 – ignorance of copyright laws.

Production by Nick Godwin – hmmm next time we’ll do it ourselves.
