Guy – usual shite, Simon – guitar and screwdriver, Alun ‘Wilf’ Williams – bass, Noel – drums, Sue Leeves – voice of Louise Michel, Jimmy Miller – background presence.

The world is changing fast – communal living in South London, demonstrations, Stonehenge and the free festivals, more political awareness and activity, hope, despair. Alun ‘Wilf’ Williams joins on bass and along with scouser Jimmy Miller moves into communal home – close friend Martin Pawson dies sending profound ripples to/from the heart of the band. Mark Tyler disappears into the ether… the Family Hawaii becoming embroiled in the local underworld… eventually to escape and return to the rolling hills of mid-Wales – but things have changed, Whats Going On? is a more anarchic collection of ideas, albeit with some extreme and powerful moments. Guy and Dave spend a couple of weeks in the editing room cutting and pasting the final mixes to create the finished article… good friend and photographer Tony Harrison emigrates to Australia after being savagely attacked and injured at a party in London. Illuminated records self destructs and again the album only available in a handful of shops in the U.K. Most of the 1250 albums pressed exported. Two different covers neither with any writing on front… but as Upset The Rhythms Chris Tipton says “even now sounds like it was beamed in from the future, the effortless experimentalism and tape collage nature of the album flows with grace and endless imagination”

Live sets continue to become more theatrical; Jim Lusted rejoins for a short tour of Switzerland culminating in headlining the Ton Zeit Ton alternative music festival in Basle with the boys resplendent in face paint, battle fatigues and – for the beginning of the set – total darkness…

Released early 1984 on Illuminated Records Jams 38
