A new Collective spirit means that all music is communally credited. Most tracks on sides 1-3 are re-worked improvisations whilst both tracks on side 4 are in their original improvised form. Ex-Amon Duul and Hawkwind bassist Dave Anderson plays on some tracks, Guy, Mark and Simon play the easier bits! Cello screeching provided by total-allergy syndrome sufferer and Greenfield Leisure member Simon ‘Klaus Wunderkind’ Pritchard along for the fresh air… a return to London and gigging (Janet Armstrong, in the audience, walks out of one gig shouting “Fucking Hippies”)… ‘Sounds’ magazine’s Dave Henderson gives “More Wealth…” a 5-star review… other review snippets: “a huge slab of mindblowing overblown dark progressive acid psychedelia” “Freaked out Krautrock” “absolutely mesmerising double album travelling through progressive rock, via industrial folk to freaky art-punk whilst sounding delightfully coherent” “an absolute gem of an album”…big interest in Europe but no record sales in Britain – years later we discover that Illuminated Records never paid their bills and the Independent Cartel of record distributors wont take Illuminated Records records… so available abroad only…
