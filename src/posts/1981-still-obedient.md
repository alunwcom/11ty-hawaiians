1. STILL OBEDIENT (Smith)
1. SHOULD YOU FORGET (Smith)

Guy – vocals and guitar, Jim – bass, Kev Armstrong – guitar and drums.

Guy and Jim pulling in different directions – band splits to leave Guy with the name and some new ideas pushing the knobs as far as they will go, Jim and Kev help out…

Most of 1981 spent recruiting new travellers. From down the road and ‘Greenfield Leisure’ came Simon Marchant and pal Cliff McLenehan on guitar and bass and from fellow South London outfit ‘A Circle Charmed’ came Noel Blanden. Improvising along with Mark Tyler who appeared out of the ether with a string synth one day, joss sticks, hash, acid and patchouli were procured to further move further away from the new romantic, mod and punk clones… it was too much for Cliff but the remaining foursome spent a couple of weeks recording demos and then were given the green light by Iluminatus fanatic Keith Bagley to record a double album at Foel Studio in mid Wales. This was perfect as Foel was built and run by ex-Amon Duul and Hawkwind bass player Dave Anderson.
